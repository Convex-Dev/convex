# Convex CLI

## Overview

The `convex-cli` module provides a CLI interface to Convex, including the ability to operate as either a client or peer on the Convex Network

## Usage Examples

### List available commands and options

```
convex --help
```

## Installation

### Pre-requisites

You need a reasonably modern version of Java, specifically 21+. You can get this here:
- [Java JDK from Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/downloads/)

### .jar file

You need the `convex-cii.jar` file. Released versions can be downloaded here:
- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/world.convex/convex-cli

The `convex-cli.jar` file can also be generated by running `mvn install` in the root directory of the convex project, in which case the built `.jar` file can be found at `convex-cli/target/convex-cli.jar`

At this point, assuming Java 21+ is correctly installed, you should simple be able to simply execute `java -jar convex-cli.jar`  (appending any appropriate CLI arguments).

### Convenience Wrappers

It is helpful to have a script or batch file which executes the Java command command for you so you can simply type `convex ....`

For Windows PowerShell, the following should work:

```
# Windows powershell - convex.ps1
java -jar path/to/convex-cli.jar $args
```

For Linux and other Unix-like systems:

```
#!/bin/bash
java -jar path/to/convex-cli.jar $@
```

Ensure the wrapper is somewhere in your `$PATH`, and you should be good to go!
