# Convex CLI

## Overview

The `convex-cli` module provides a CLI interface to Convex, including the ability to operate as either a client or peer on the Convex Network

## Usage Examples

### List available commands and options

```
convex --help
```

### Generating a key pair

To execute transactions or operate peers on Convex you will need a cryptographic Ed25519 key pair.

Key pairs are stored in a PKCS #12 key store. By default this is stored in the user's home directory in the location `~/.convex/keystore.pfx`. The keystore encrypts keys so that they cannot be accessed without the correct passwords.

To generate a cryptographic key, it is recommended to use the following command:

```
convex key generate --bip39
```

This generates and outputs a BIP39 mnemonic phrase of 12 words consistent with the BIP39 standard. The words will look something like this:

```
evidence expand family claw crack dawn name salmon resource leg once curious
```

You will be also prompted for three keys:
- The overall password for the key store. This is shared for all keys in the key store
- A BIP39 passphrase. This is the passphrase that will be used to generate the 
- A private key encryption password. This protects the new key generated

If you wish to be able to recover the private key, you should make sure you securely record the following:
- The BIP39 mnemonic word list
- The BIP39 passphrase
 
### Importing a key pair

To re-import a key pair from a BIP39 seed, you can used the following command:

```
convex key import --type=bip39 --text='evidence expand family claw crack dawn name salmon resource leg once curious'
```

This will re-import the same key pair that was generated, assuming you have the correct BIP39 passphrase. You can confirm this by checking that the public key is the one you expect.

## Installation

### Pre-requisites

You need a reasonably modern version of Java, specifically 21+. You can get this here:
- [Java JDK from Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/downloads/)

### .jar file

You need the `convex-cii.jar` file. Released versions can be downloaded here:
- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/world.convex/convex-cli

The `convex-cli.jar` file can also be generated by running `mvn install` in the root directory of the convex project, in which case the built `.jar` file can be found at `convex-cli/target/convex-cli.jar`

At this point, assuming Java 21+ is correctly installed, you should simple be able to simply execute `java -jar convex-cli.jar`  (appending any appropriate CLI arguments).

### Convenience Wrappers

It is helpful to have a script or batch file which executes the Java command command for you so you can simply type `convex ....`

For Windows PowerShell, the following should work:

```
# Windows powershell - convex.ps1
java -jar path/to/convex-cli.jar $args
```

For Linux and other Unix-like systems:

```
#!/bin/bash
java -jar path/to/convex-cli.jar $@
```

Ensure the wrapper is somewhere in your `$PATH`, and you should be good to go!
