## Usage

### Building

You will need a recent version of Java (21+) and Maven (3.7+) installed

You can then build the latest version of Convex Desktop as follows:

- Download the convex repository via git `https://github.com/Convex-Dev/convex.git` or using the zip download `https://github.com/Convex-Dev/convex/archive/refs/heads/develop.zip`
- Run `mvn install` in the root directory (this will build all Convex modules)
- The Convex `.jar` file should be created at `convex-integration/target/convex.jar` 

### Running Convex Desktop

If Java is properly installed on your machine, you should be able to run the `convex.jar` file directly as a Java application (double click on Windows).

Alternatively, from the command line you can run the desktop with a Java command such as:

```bash
java -jar convex.jar desktop
```

This launches the Convex Desktop application main screen.
