;;;;;;;;;; State

;; Token metadata is stored here
;; Map of { id -> [controller supply underlying-asset underlying-balance underlying-claimed] ]
(def tokens {})

;; Per-user data is stored in holdings: Map of { id -> [balance offers claimed] }
;; where:
;;    balance is a non-negative Integer
;;    offers is nil or a map of { address -> offer amount }
;;    claimed is amount of underlying asset claimed

(def counter 0)

;; The BIG idea: by tracking the number of claimed underlying tokens for each holder
;; as well as the total amount claimed, we can allow holders to claim a proportionate share
;; of the underlying balance
;;
;; Complexities to bear in mind:
;; - when shares are transferred, we also transfer unclaimed amount
;; - multiple share tokens may have same underlying asset, so they must track independent balances
