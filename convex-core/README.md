# Convex Core

## Overview

Convex Core is the fundamental code base for Convex

It includes:
 - Implementations of all Convex decentralised data structures
 - Implementation of the Convex Virtual Machine (CVM)
 - Convergent Proof of Stake consensus algorithm
 - The Etch database and storage system
 - Common utility functions (including cryptography support)

Convex Core is designed as a library to support applications in the Convex ecosystem. It can be used directly and embedded in JVM applications that wish to work with Convex data structures directly.
