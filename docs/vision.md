# Vision

Convex is an open exchange for digital value. 

Throughout history, people have improved their lives and societies by exchanging good and services to fulfil their needs. Marketplaces, trade routes, legal systems, currencies and financial institutions developed to support value exchange over the centuries. 

In the modern world, assets are increasingly managed with digital systems, and in many cases are entirely digital themselves. However the facilities to enable value to be exchanged for such assets are still mostly dependent on traditional and inefficient mechanisms:

- Contracts are costly to write and agree, and enforced via expensive lawyers and slow legal systems 
- Payments are managed via huge centralised financial institutions with high transaction costs
- Fiat currencies are issued at the whim of national governments, and carry notable risks as a long term store of value (inflation, safe custody)
- Significant risks plague the economic system (operational risk, systematic financial risk etc.) which make value exchange dangerous and create a requirement for burdensome due diligence
- Many individuals are excluded from participation in the financial system, because of significant barriers and costs

We can do better. 

Convex provides the foundation for efficient digital value exchange. It is a ground-up re-imagining of what is needed to support efficient, transparent and fair economic systems in the digital age.

## What you can build on top of Convex

There are no limitations on the types of digital value exchange applications or assets that you can build with Convex. Convex smart contracts are fully programmable and "Turing Complete", so you can build anything.

Convex is also open and free to use. So you don't need anyone's permission to build. Just do it.

Here are some examples:

- **Digital currencies** (stablecoins, central bank issued, commercial bank issues)
- **Real asset ownership** (real estate, high value goods)
- **Digital equities** (shares in real world companies)
- **Derivatives** (futures and options on other digital assets)
- **Digital Autonomous Organisations** (virtual companies)
- **Games** involving digital asset ownership
- **Digital licenses**
- **Immutable provenance** for data or asset authenticity, e.g. for regulatory usage
- **Public databases**
- **Self-sovereign identity**

## What we need to deliver

To realise our vision, the Convex Foundation and core team are building:

* **Global Database**: A consistent, replicated database capable of tracking all assets in circulation, and public information required to facilitate transactions. This must be scalable enough to handle global transactions (i.e. VISA-like transaction volumes)
* **Utility coin**: The Convex coin is required to pay transaction costs to use the network. It serves as the native cryptocurrency on the platform, and for may be used for other platform facilities such as staking. Like Bitcoin, it has a *limited supply* guaranteed by the protocol.
* **Secure Ownership**: Secure cryptographic techniques are needed ensure that assets are under the control of the owner, and nobody else. Control over assets can be exercised only via transactions signed with a specific private key.
* **Trusted Execution**: Deterministic, programmable, verifiable smart contracts are required so that participants can rely upon then to precisely enforce terms and conditions of value exchange. The platform that enables trusted execution is the Convex Virtual Machine (CVM)
* **Consensus Algorithm**: An algorithm is required to ensure verifiable consensus across the network, so that ownership of assets / execution of contracts can be uniquely and reliably determined (avoiding the infamous "double spend" problem)
* **Autonomous Actors**: Self-operating, unstoppable economic agents executing on the network can automatically fulfil important roles in the digital economy, perhaps even operating as virtual companies in their own right.
* **Public Utility Network** A decentralised, public, permissionless network that anyone can access to transact without censorship or centralised gatekeepers.

As of now, we are able to demonstrate working examples of all the above. After a period of public development and refinement, this will transition rapidly towards the launch of the main production network.

## Good Governance

It is not sufficient to simply deliver technology.

We require mechanisms that ensure the platform is **governed effectively and efficiently** now and in the future, in the joint interests of all builders, users and coin holders. We are ultimately trying to build a shared public utility that everyone can use.

To achieve this, we are establishing the **Convex Foundation**, an organisation that will be responsible for building, delivering and managing the Convex public network. 

We do **not allow forks** in the Convex network. Some people seem to think that forks are good things for decentralised systems, but we disagree strongly. This is for the following reasons:

- Forks are harmful to users in the ecosystem - they create uncertainty over asset holdings, and which fork to build upon 
- From an economic perspective, forks destroy value by subdividing the market and making cross-fork transactions more difficult
- Forks create unnecessary political problems, which are a distraction and risk to people involved in the ecosystem
- Technical improvements can and should be evaluated on their merits and rolled out responsibly

Initially the Foundation will be managed by the founding team. As soon as practical this will be converted to decentralised governance, jointly owned by participants in the broader ecosystem. We will consider "on-chain" governance mechanisms, but it is important to note that such solutions are currently immature and unproven and there will always need to be some real world execution that requires off-chain governance.

## Principles

We shall design and build Convex according to the following principles:

* **Self-Sovereignty** - Individuals should have ownership and control of their own digital identity and assets
* **Neutrality** - The Convex platform and governance shall be totally neutral to all users, and will never censor legitimate transactions.
* **Decentralisation** - Our aim is to be fully decentralised, both as a technical platform and in terms of long term governance of the Foundation
* **Sustainability** - We will ensure that all Convex technology is efficient and environmentally sustainable, and in particular does not create an incentive to waste energy or computational resources (e.g. Proof of Work)  
* **Simplicity** - Our technology and user experience must be simple, in the sense that it is based on foundational concepts and building blocks that a robust and reusable
* **Unbreaking** - We shall strive to achieve zero breaking changes or forks in the production network. The only such changes that will be allowed are to fix systematic threats to network security or governance.
* **Builders First** - Individuals and organisations that invest their time and money in building the Convex platform and ecosystem will own all newly issued coins, and shall have the greatest influence over future direction
