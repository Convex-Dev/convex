# Convex Network Governance Rules

## Preamble

The Convex Network Governance Rules (the "CNGRs") are maintained by the Convex Foundation acting as the Governance Body to serve the interests of the Convex Ecosystem.

In particular, the CNGRs are intended to ensure a long-lived public utility network for the Internet of Value, supporting decentralised economic systems and open to all participants as a public good.

The CNGRs therefore apply to parties that wish to use Convex technology to operate decentralised economic systems ("Operators" in this document). 

Feedback and PRs are welcome, as are discussions on the [Convex Discord](https://discord.com/invite/xfYGq4CT7v)

## Foundation Commitment

The Governing Body is committed to serving the Convex ecosystem. In particular it will:

1. Continue to make all core Convex technology available on an open source basis under the latest version of the Convex Public License

2. Collaborate with Operators to ensure that the Convex Network(s) serves the interests of the Convex ecosystem on a non-discriminatory basis.

3. Make governance decisions on a neutral and non-discriminatory basis, in the interests of the Convex ecosystem as a whole.

4. Maintain and update the CNGRs as necessary and in the spirit of running a well governed, open, decentralised public utility network.

The Convex Foundation intends to evolve governance over time to best support the needs of the ecosystem. In the long run, it is intended to implement mechanisms of decentralised governance, wherein Users and Operators of the Convex Network shall be appropriately represented.


## Definitions

"Network" shall mean a set of systems maintaining consensus and facilitating transactions using Convex technology, including any software licensed under the Convex Public License, where that network facilitates decentralised economic systems.

"Main Network" shall mean the primary public Network, officially identified by the Convex Foundation.

"Peer" shall mean any system which participates in the running of the Network, including establishing consensus and computing updates the global state. 

"Operator" shall mean any legal entity that operates one or more Peers, i.e. is an active participant in the running of the Network

"Fork" shall mean a situation where the state managed by the Network diverges on two different and incompatible paths, e.g. by disagreement on transaction ordering or the resulting state.

"Clients" shall mean any system that utilises the facilities of the network, typically by querying data or submitting transactions.

"Users" shall mean any person or legal entity that makes use of the Network. Users may directly make use Client software, or indirectly interact with the Network via third parties.

"Update" shall mean a change to the Network protocol, transaction ordering or state that results in a requirement to change Peer behaviour. An Update shall normally be delivered via a new version of relevant Convex software technology, plus any operational instructions required to cause the update to come into effect.

"Convex Coin" is the Utility Token used to manage the Convex Network, which shall be issued by the Convex Foundation on the Main Network.

## Rules

### Honest Operation

Operators MUST operate Peers on the Network honestly and in good faith, with the purpose of maintaining the Network securely and efficiently on behalf of all Clients.

### Network Update

Operators MUST ensure that their Peer(s) are updated according to the requirements of any Update if they wish to continue operation.

The Governing Body shall give timely notice to Operators regarding any required update, and Operators MAY choose to withdraw from the network if they are unwilling or unable to comply with the relevant requirements. 

### Non-discrimination

Operators MUST NOT discriminate between transactions on the Network where those transactions have already been submitted by any Operator, excepting that:

Operators SHOULD ignore, block or blacklist other Operators where they have a reasonable belief that the other Operator is behaving maliciously or erroneously. This obligation should be regarded as consistent with the requirement to maintain the network securely and efficiently.

### Asset protection

Operators MUST recognise that digital assets, information and smart contracts on the Network may represent real assets owned by Users and MUST NOT take any action that compromises the ownership, control or access that Users have regarding such assets.

Operators MUST ensure that all such assets are controlled only according to protocol rules as defined in the most recent Update.

In the event that corrective action is required (e.g. in the event of a serious failure in security) such corrective action shall be implemented via an Update. 

### Intellectual Property

Operators agree to use Convex Technology to operate their Peer(s) under the terms of the Convex Public License (CPL).

To the extent that Operators make changes to technology licensed under the CPL, Operators SHOULD make these changes publicly available to the ecosystem as contributions under the CPL. Operators MUST do this if the terms of the CPL require them to do so (e.g. when distributing a derivative work).

Operators MAY independently create and use any software to interact with the network that they wish, and license this as they choose, providing that the use of such software does not conflict with their obligations as an Operator under the CPL or CNGRs.

### Client Services

Operators MAY submit transactions to the Network on behalf of Clients, but are not required to do so. 

Operators MAY determine which transactions they submit in any way they see fit, which may include charging additional fees for services.

### Disaster Recovery

Operators MUST employ their best endeavours to recover from any adverse scenarios which impact the regular operations of the Network, so that normal operations can be resumed as soon as practically possible. 

Operators SHOULD collaborate with the Governing Body and other operators on the Network to prepare for and execute disaster recovery plans as far as reasonably possible. 

Operators recognise that disaster recovery may necessitate an emergency Update, and SHOULD plan appropriately to facilitate this at short notice.

### Fork Prevention

Operators MUST NOT create, cause, facilitate or continue to operate a Fork of the Network, except where such a Fork is formally approved by the Governing Body.

In the event that a Fork is caused accidentally (e.g. by a serious partition of the global Internet) Operators MUST rejoin the Fork supported by the majority of network state at the time of forking. 

In the event that Operators are unable to identify or agree on a Fork to support within 48 hours, the Convex Foundation Shall determine the fork that shall be considered as fork of the Network and notify all Operators.

### Stake Forfeiture

Operators agree that any stake they place upon Peers that they operate may be forfeited if they maliciously or negligently fail to operate a Peer in accordance with the CNGRs. 

Stake Forfeiture may occur automatically as part of the protocol ("slashing") or in exceptional cases via an independent determination of malicious or negligent practices.

### Withdrawal

Operators MAY withdraw their stake and cease participation at any time, providing that such withdrawal is done according to protocol rules and the terms of the CNGRs.

### Legal Compliance

Operators MUST comply with relevant laws and regulations in their own jurisdiction. If they are unable to do so while complying with the terms of this License, they MUST withdraw from participation in the Network.

### Subnets

Convex is designed to operate a decentralised Main Network with a single consensus and Global State, since this provides a consistent, reliable and effective substrate for decentralised economic systems.

However, it is recognised that there may be instances where it is desirable to operate a Network which is separate from the Main Network, for example as a private chain or a segregated public chain for a specific use case.

Operators MAY create and operate a Subnet freely providing all the following are true:

- The utility token utilised on the Subnet is backed 1:1 by the Convex Coin
- The Subnet is operated as a Network according to the CNGRs
- The Operator provides or otherwise makes available a free facility to enable any participants on the Subnet to move Convex Coins between the Subnet and the Main Network on a timely and non-discriminatory basis

Alternatively, Operators MAY submit a request to the Governing Body to operate a Subnet under alternative terms. Such requests shall be assessed and granted at the Governing Body's sole and absolute discretion on the basis of whether the proposed Subnet serves the overall interests of the Convex ecosystem.

### Testing and Development

Operators MAY freely operate a Network for testing and development purposes providing that the following requirements are met:

- It is not used to facilitate real economic transactions (simulations, experiments and proofs of concept are OK)
- They do not mislead any party into believing the test network is a real Network and/or relying upon it as such

A Network used for testing and development in this way is not otherwise bound by the CNGRs
