## Why should I use Convex?

That's up to you! But we hope you'll find it compelling for these sort of reasons:

- A fun and empowering experience as a developer
- The ability to easily build powerful decentralised applications
- Probably the best overall performance of any decentralised platform 


## But XXX is faster! It can do YY million transactions per second!

Maybe. We're not really in the game of competing on the basis of meaningless benchmarks.

It's important to remember that performance isn't about a single number. It's about the being able to get what you want done quickly and efficiently, as a user of the system. 

We've seen plenty of big performance claims for decentralised platforms. The headlines may be impressive, but a lot of these don't really stack up when you examine more closely. Usually there are some significant compromises made to achieve these numbers. You can look out for: Unrealistic testing setups. Relaxed security requirements (e.g. using PoA networks). Networks that can't handle general purpose smart contracts. Issues with transactions that span across shards. Long time delays to confirm final consensus.
