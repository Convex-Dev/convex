## Convex Ethos

### Privacy

We support the principle that individuals should have a right to privacy, and the Convex Organisation will not disclose any personal information without the individual's consent.

This principle is also built into the Convex protocol at a technical level, as participants may choose to operate under pseudonymous accounts.

### Strong Opinions, Weakly Held

Producing a complex product requires hard decisions. Making decisions well is a difficult art. Nobody has all the answers, and the best solutions come from incorporating the strongest ideas, regardless of source.

In order to have a realistic plan, it is necessary to form an initial hypothesis on the solution. This is not necessarily the final answer, but a starting assumption on which to iterate and improve. As new information becomes available, the team should be willing to amend this hypothesis in light of new information and experience.

### Obligation to Dissent

It is our belief that the best ideas are those that are developed under an environment of honest, constructive criticism. It is therefore our expectation that all team members should speak up if they feel that something is being done the wrong way, and have a better solution to propose.

### Backwards Compatibility

We commit to maintaining backwards compatibility as a core feature of the Convex system. It is unacceptable for breaking changes to occur in underlying infrastructure once working systems are in production.

Special exceptions may be made in extreme circumstances (e.g. fixing fundamental security flaws). It is our goal that this never occurs, but we must be prepared for such an eventuality.
