## Non-technical Challenges

As well as technical challenges, the Blockchain sector has faced some significant non-technical challenges.

* **Illegal Activity** - The anonymous nature of blockchain technology has unfortunately proved valuable for criminals wishing to transfer assets without being identified or tracked. It has facilitated a number of scams and schemes to "get rich quick" of dubious legality. It has also proved rich picking for "black hat" hackers exploiting other users of the network.
* **Over promising** - Many projects launched on a wave of "Blockchain Hype" promised the world, but in fact were unable to deliver. This tendency to over-hype technology is not new (witness the "dotcom bubble") but certainly harmed the credibility of the sector.
* **Inappropriate Application** - In many cases, applications being built with blockchain technology (particularly in the "Enterprise" space) would be better served by traditional database / server technology. While blockchains offer some significant benefits, they require significant trade-offs. In general, applications that are operated by a controlled set of trusted participants do not require decentralisation.
* **Education** - Typical users often do not have the skills to interact with decentralised applications directly, such as management of private keys. While 3rd parties may innovate in providing key management services or more pleasant user experiences, this re-introduces the problem of trusting a centralised gatekeeper, and opens up more potential security risks.
* **Forking** - major blockchain networks have seen "forks" where ecosystems have broken into two or more incompatible networks, perhaps over political differences on whether or not to make a specific technical change on the network. While forking may allow for some interesting technical differentiation, it is an unhelpful property for economic systems - where the ability for economic actors to transact freely with all others is important.

### Fundamental Principles

* **Decentralisation** : Economic value exchange must be a public good, open to all, and not controlled by any centralised entity. Without decentralisation, the digital economy will be unfair (not accessible to all) and inefficient (monopoly rents and barriers to entry imposed by centralised gatekeepers). 
* **Governance**: The Convex network itself, should serve the interests of the whole community of users, and network governance must be neutral in all matters other than technical operation and improvements to the network.
* **Transparency**: As a public service, the state of the network and all transactions should be publicly visible and verifiable to all.
* **Privacy**: Convex may be used anonymously to protect individual identities.
* **Trust**: In economic transactions, it is often necessary for participants to trust the legal entity they are transacting with. It is important to provide safeguards against illegal activity, and recourse to real-world legal and regulatory solutions.
