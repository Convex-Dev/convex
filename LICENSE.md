# License

Convex Public Licence ("CPL") v0.5

# Preamble

This license is intended to support the open development of software within the Convex ecosystem, with two primary objectives:

A) Enable Open Source development and usage of systems based on Convex technology
B) Ensure effective governance of economic systems and networks based on Convex technology

As such the license has been written based on the following principles:

- It is a "weak copyleft" open source license, similar in spirit to the Eclipse Public License. Derivative Works and any Contributions must be released under the same license. However, you may link and utilise the Work from software using a different license, including use as a library commercial and proprietary software.
- It is intended to support good governance of the decentralised Convex network, and therefore gives certain governance powers to a Governing Body (at time of writing the non-profit Convex Foundation). The Governing Body, in turn, is expected to use these powers to serve the interests of the whole ecosystem.

"Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

"Economic Assets" shall mean entities with economic or commercial value, or from which economic or commercial value may be derived, through the exercise of partial or exclusive control. An Economic Asset may be entirely digital, a legal right, an asset that exists in the physical world, or any combination of these.

"Decentralised Economic System" shall mean any system where any of the following are true:
- Consensus over some information of economic interest is determined between two or more Legal Entities
- Economic Assets are under the control of two or more Legal Entities
- Transactions are executed that represent exchange of value between two or more Legal Entities

## 3. Distribution

You may distribute the Work (or Derivative Work) under this Licence, provided that:

  1. The Work (or Derivative Work) must also be made available as Source Code, and You must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
  2. The Work (or Derivative Work) must be distributed either under this license, or a later version of this license formally approved by the Governance Body.
  3. You agree that any change you make to the Work shall be considered a Contribution.

## 5. Submission of Contributions. 

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this Licence, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

## 6. Trademarks.

## 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. 

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Contributor grants to the Governing Body a perpetual, worldwide, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable right to re-distribute Contributions under any license, including future revisions of this license, providing that such license is formally approved by the Governing Body. The Governing Body will ensure that this Work is always free and open source for anyone to use within the Convex ecosystem.

## 11. Decentralised Execution

Licensee acknowledges and agrees that their use of the work (directly or indirectly) may include the execution of transactions on a public, decentralised network, and as such they agree to the following:

- Transactions that they execute may be publicly visible, including any personal information contained therein.
- Contracts may be executed according to rules defined by software code either deployed to the Network or as part of the execution environment defined within this Work. 
- Access to or control of digital assets and other economically valuable systems may depend on cryptographic keys and signatures, and it is the responsibility of Licensee to ensure that such keys are properly secured.

Licensee accepts full responsibility for the consequences of executing transactions on such a network, and authorises operators of the network to carry out execution as described here. If Licensee executes transactions on behalf of a third party, it is the responsibility of Licensee to ensure that any such party agrees to these terms, and Licensee shall indemnify operators of the Convex Network against any consequences of a failure to do so. 

## 12. Contributor Awards
