# License

Convex Public Licence ("CPL") v0.9

# Preamble

This license is intended to support the open development of software within the Convex ecosystem, with two primary objectives:

A) Enable Open Source development and usage of systems based on Convex technology
B) Ensure effective governance of economic systems and networks based on Convex technology

As such the license has been written based on the following principles:

- It is a "weak copyleft" open source license, similar in spirit to the Eclipse Public License. Derivative Works and any Contributions must be released under the same license. However, you may link and utilise the Work from software using a different license, including use as a library for commercial and proprietary software.
- It is intended to support good governance of the decentralised Convex network, and therefore gives certain governance powers to a Governing Body (at time of writing the non-profit Convex Foundation). The Governing Body, in turn, is expected to use these powers to serve the interests of the whole ecosystem.

  4. A decentralised entity operating either autonomously or under the control of one or more Legal Entities.

"Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

"Economic Assets" shall mean entities with economic or commercial value, or from which economic or commercial value may be derived, through the exercise of partial or exclusive control. An Economic Asset may be entirely digital, a legal right, an asset that exists in the physical world, or any combination of these.

"Decentralised Economic System" shall mean any system where any of the following are true:
- Consensus over some information of economic interest is determined between two or more Legal Entities
- Economic Assets are under the control of two or more Legal Entities

The current version shall be made publicly available by the Governance Body, at time of writing [here](docs/network-governance-rules.md).

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 3. Distribution

You may distribute the Work (or Derivative Work) under this Licence, provided that:

  1. The Work (or Derivative Work) must also be made available as Source Code, and You must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
  2. The Work (or Derivative Work) must be distributed either under this license, or a later version of this license formally approved by the Governance Body.
  3. You agree that any change you make to the Work shall be considered a Contribution.

## 5. Submission of Contributions 

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this Licence, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

## 6. Trademarks

This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use including, but not limited to, describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of any NOTICE file.

## 7. Disclaimer of Warranty 

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this Licence.

## 8. Limitation of Liability 

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

## 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability 

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor or Operator, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor or Operator harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor or Operator by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## 10. Relicensing 

Contributor grants to the Governing Body a perpetual, worldwide, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable right to re-distribute Contributions under any license, including future revisions of this license, providing that such license is formally approved by the Governing Body. The Governing Body will ensure that this Work is always free and open source for anyone to use within the Convex ecosystem.

## 11. Decentralised Execution

Licensee acknowledges and agrees that their use of the Work (directly or indirectly) may include the execution of transactions on a public, decentralised network, and as such they agree to the following:

- Transactions that they execute may be publicly visible, including any personal information contained therein.
- Contracts may be executed according to rules defined by software code either deployed to the Network or as part of the execution logic encoded within this Work. 
- Access to or control of digital assets and other economically valuable systems may depend on cryptographic keys and signatures, and it is the responsibility of Licensee to ensure that such keys are properly secured. Not your keys, not your crypto.

Licensee accepts full responsibility for the consequences of executing transactions on such a network, and authorises Operators of the network to carry out execution as described here. 

If Licensee executes transactions or facilitates such execution on behalf of a third party, it is the responsibility of Licensee to ensure that any such party agrees to these terms, and Licensee shall fully indemnify Contributors and Operators against any consequences of a failure to do so. 

## 12. Contributor Awards

The Governing Body may, at its sole and absolute discretion, make awards of Convex Coins for Contributions to the Work. To be eligible for such awards, Contributor agrees to sign a Contributor Agreement which may be made available separately from this License.
